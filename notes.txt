Berka Dataset - Well behaved test case for LLM parsing: https://webpages.charlotte.edu/mirsad/itcs6265/group1/domain.html
Random Gen Dataset - Poorly behaved / stressed data engi test case for LLM parsing ( random tables like our SQL server ( out of date tables, broken tables, empty tables, unrelated/reused names. ver2. ver2final etc.))
 
start by feeding the information schema into the llm ( info schema from SSMS)


need to find a method of summarizing schema analysis 

here's the northwinds databasE: https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/sample-data/northwind/ -- northwind is in our master database


# pull in schema info from mssqls
# inject it to the query of the LLM with some compression and see if - along with the user query- it can pick out what tables should be necessary
